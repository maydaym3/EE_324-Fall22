2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/genblk3_0.bram36_single_bl.bram36_single_bl has an input control pin Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/genblk3_0.bram36_single_bl.bram36_single_bl/ADDRARDADDR[4] (net: Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ADDRARDADDR[0]) which is driven by a register (VGA/Vertical_Count_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#2 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/genblk3_0.bram36_single_bl.bram36_single_bl has an input control pin Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/genblk3_0.bram36_single_bl.bram36_single_bl/ADDRARDADDR[5] (net: Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ADDRARDADDR[1]) which is driven by a register (VGA/Vertical_Count_reg[1]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#3 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/genblk3_0.bram36_single_bl.bram36_single_bl has an input control pin Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/genblk3_0.bram36_single_bl.bram36_single_bl/ADDRARDADDR[6] (net: Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ADDRARDADDR[2]) which is driven by a register (VGA/Vertical_Count_reg[2]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-1839#4 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/genblk3_0.bram36_single_bl.bram36_single_bl has an input control pin Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/genblk3_0.bram36_single_bl.bram36_single_bl/ADDRARDADDR[7] (net: Data/ascii_rom/BRAM_SINGLE_MACRO_inst/ADDRARDADDR[3]) which is driven by a register (VGA/Vertical_Count_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
